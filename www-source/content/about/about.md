Title: Where it all began
Draft: false

Inspired by everything from Star Trek to the Tesla car, I've embarked on a journey to transform my truck from mundane to something that is more than meets the eye. Ever since I was old enough to drive, I've dreamed of having a car with a computerized dashboard, but it seemed out of reach until recently. With the advent of affordable tiny embedded computers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi I was finally ready to make this a reality. I wanted a system that could grow with my dreams, so I created CADI, an open source Computer Aided Dashboard Instrumentation system.
